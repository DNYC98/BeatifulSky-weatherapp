# BeatifulSky-weatherapp
A site on which you can type a certain location or use the "current location" to find the weather forecast
the sky is currently still but i am working on making the background reactive to the API response
as if it says it will rain, show rainy sky
hot weather maybe put a hot beach and so on...
